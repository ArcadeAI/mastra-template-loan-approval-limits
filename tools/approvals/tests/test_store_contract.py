"""The approvals store contract, driven end to end over real HTTP.

`tools/approvals/README.md` writes this contract out in Markdown, because
whoever builds #19 works in TypeScript and should not have to read Python to
build against it. This file is that prose with a runnable counterpart: every
endpoint, the one record shape, the 401 on each, and the 404s.

It uses a plain HTTP client rather than `approvals/store.py`, deliberately.
`GET /approvals/{id}` is the read #19's page is built on and **nothing in this
toolkit calls it** — a Python client nobody uses would be dead code in a
deployed worker. Driving the contract directly is how it gets exercised without
inventing a caller for it, and it also means these assertions are about the
wire rather than about our client's opinion of the wire.
