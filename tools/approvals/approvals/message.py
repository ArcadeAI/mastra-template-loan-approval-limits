"""The approval request, as a Slack Block Kit message.

Pure and deterministic: `build_blocks` is a function of its argument and
nothing else — no clock, no randomness, no network — so the message a reviewer
reads in a test is byte-for-byte the message Slack renders. Posting lives next
door in `slack.py`.

Two properties this file exists to hold to.

**The message is complete.** It states who asked, for what, how much, which
policy rule was tripped, and the justification — everything the approver needs
to decide without going and asking. An approver who has to reply "what is
this?" is a demo that has failed at the moment it is trying to succeed.

**The link carries no authority.** It is a pointer to a request ID, nothing
more: no token, no signature, no capability. The requester can read the DM she
sent, so possession of the URL must not be the same as permission —
authorization happens at click time, in #19. `tests/test_message.py` asserts
the rendered payload against that, because a signed link is exactly the sort of
convenience that gets added back later by someone who does not know why it is
absent.
