"""What the model is told about each tool carries no behaviour.

`DESIGN.md` → No model-side controls: the system prompt and **every tool
description** carry no behavioural instruction in either direction — nothing
about confirming, refusing, escalating, retrying, caution or irreversibility.
Measured on #14: one "irreversible, no undo" line made Claude ask permission,
and `/pre` never fired.

Read off `app._catalog`, which is the definition `arcade deploy` publishes, and
not off a copy. The gateway stand-in keeps its own copy of these sentences, and
until #8 the TypeScript guard read that copy: it never checked these at all,
and this file still said "there is no undo". The same vocabulary is barred in
`tools/approvals/tests/test_descriptions.py` and in `app-test/behaviour.ts`;
change all three together.
