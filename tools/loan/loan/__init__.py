"""The loan toolkit: four tools, each a stateless client of `apps/loan-app`.

Nothing here holds state and nothing here decides anything. Every tool takes
the caller's OAuth token, hands it to the bank's API, and returns what the API
returns. The API derives who is acting from that token; the tools never say.

Whether a caller *may* do what they are asking is not this toolkit's question
either — that is decided by the hooks in `apps/hooks`, on a path these tools
cannot see. The auth requirement on each tool carries identity, not authority.

The tool descriptions were written to be picked by a model without prompt
coaching and reviewed on that basis. They came across from the previous MCP
surface verbatim; change the wording only for a reason that survives review.
